# Topological Data Analysis in Neuroscience (TDA+Neuro)

## Description/contents: 
In recent years, ideas from TDA have been increasingly adopted in order to analyze neuroscientific data. Of particular interest are TDA techniques which can summarize the information contained in the joint activation patterns of ensmebles of neurons. This topic course will overview the main ideas in this field.
